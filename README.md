# 🌍 IoT-Based Earthquake Detection Station

An intelligent real-time seismic monitoring system designed to detect and classify earthquake activity. The project is composed of two main components:

- 📡 **Station Side** – Collects seismic acceleration data and sends it wirelessly via UDP.
- 🖥️ **Server Side** – Receives, processes, and classifies data using machine learning, and visualizes the results via a web dashboard.

## 🖥️ Server Side Overview

The server processes incoming seismic data and makes real-time predictions using a trained Random Forest model. It then updates a live web dashboard to notify users of potential earthquake activity.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-Time Seismic Detection** – Uses a calibrated accelerometer to monitor ground motion.
- **False Alarm Filtering with AI** – A Random Forest model classifies real earthquakes from non-seismic events.
- **Live Web Dashboard** – Displays live events and predictions.
- **Energy-Efficient Design** – Activates only during vibration for optimal power usage.
- **Modular and Scalable** – Easily deploy multiple stations for broader coverage.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The station samples acceleration data using an MPU-6050 sensor.
- If shaking is detected, the system transmits the first 200 acceleration readings via UDP.
- The server receives this data and classifies it using a pre-trained Random Forest model.
- If it’s an earthquake, the event is logged and displayed on a web interface.
- If its not an earthquake, the server chooses to ignore the data.
